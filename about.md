## Introduction

The purpose of the project is to provide biologists and bioinformaticians new to the field with a single resource to find out about best practice for common high-throughput approaches.

In particular, we provide:

- the steps considered necessary in a particular kind of analysis
- the current knowledge about theoretical considerations for each step, with references
- minimum standards for describing the analysis

We believe that by making best practices more accessible, the quality of analysis performed by the field as a whole can improve.

All the pages are stored on GitHub, and we encourage anyone to join and [contribute to the materials](get_involved.html).

## About the team

This webpage was first created as part of the [TGAC](http://www.tgac.ac.uk/) workshop on science reproducibility, by:

- Richard Smith-Unna
- Jelena Aleksic
- Martin Dahlö
- Catherine Shang
- Luis Pedro Coelho, inspired by discussions emerging from the workshop.
